# 🌱 APS OOP – Environmental Awareness Game (Java)

This project was developed as part of a university assignment called **APS – Supervised Practical Activities**. It is a 2D game created in **Java** with the goal of promoting **environmental awareness** through fun and educational gameplay. The game also served as a way to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in practice.

## 🎮 Gameplay

In the game, the player collects waste spread throughout the map and must sort it into the correct bins:
